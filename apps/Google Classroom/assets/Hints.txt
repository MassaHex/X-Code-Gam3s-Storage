I'll show him
--
This is becoming a
hassle
--
How has he not
given up yet?
--
This is gonna
take hours to fill
--
He's making a lotta
money from treasure 
--
Man he just doesn't
give up
--
He's keeping cool in
the hot layers
--
He keeps getting more
fuel to get deeper
--
I bet he's using the
boost in tough areas
--
I've heard there are
dinosaurs down there
--
I've heard aliens
hide underground
--
I wonder what's at
the center of Earth
--
I need to get me 
a diamond shovel
--
I am error
--
It's a secret
to everyone
--
I'm tired of spending
my nights this way
--
I could go for some
Chungus soup
--
There are 6 layers
of the Earth
--
He might actually
pull this off
--
I didn't think he'd
actually keep trying
--
This is getting old
--
Yawn
--
Ugh
--
I should be levelling
my warrior right now
--
I feel like someone
is watching me
--
Whoa this is deep!
--
Eventually gravity
wont help him
--
Where does he get
all his stuff??
--
Big gulps huh?
Well, see ya later!
--
Hint: Don't make a
bet against this kid
--
I'm missing my show
because of this
--
I should buy an MP3
player
--
I should buy a bear
trap
--
I should buy a cement
mixer
--
How does he find the
time for this?
--
I'm getting tired
--
I need to Tom Sawyer
this operation
--
What time is it?
--
Sun's almost up
--
How did he get out
of there?
--
I'm hungry
--
I could go for a
soda right now
--
Almost done
--
I wonder what kinda
things are down there
--
cough
--
I should stop talking
to myself
--
Just about done here
--
He'll never make it
to China
--
Heh heh heh
--
My arms are getting
tired
--
This is quite the
workout
--
Better diggers prolly
dig hard layers nicer
--
Turn while slow to
make sharper turns
--
Save your boost for
tougher sections
