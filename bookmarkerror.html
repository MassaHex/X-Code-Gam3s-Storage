<h1 align="center">Hello! Seems you ran into an error don&#39;t worry!</h1>

<h2 id="-easy-fix">⚒️ Easy Fix</h2>
<p>It&#39;s quite easy; all you have to do is copy the script from <a href="bookmarkcopy.js">BookmarkCopy.js</a> after which you may add the script to your bookmarks bar. Depending on the website you are on, a popup will open on click. After clicking the bookmark you added click export to save the file from the game on the old site, then navigate to the new X-Code Gam3s website URL and on the same game you were on then click the bookmark, then hit import to load the previously downloaded file, and you&#39;re done!</p>
